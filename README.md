### About
This is mostly following along with a youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvlyzDZDEq4) about creating a video chat app with WebRTC. Though instead I've changed it up a bit so that it's only an audio stream application.

This is mostly to learn some basics of using PeerJS and WebRTC.

### Install
Need too install peer globally through npm
`npm i -g peer`
`npm install`

### Running
Start up the peer server on a port
`peer --port 3001`

Start the node app
`npm run devStart`

Open `localhost:3000` in one browser tab, copy the link, paste into another browser tab. Now you can talk to yourself, congrats! Make sure to enable microphone on each tab.
